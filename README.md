# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various **machine learning projects** focusing on implementing algorithms from scratch and experimenting with different techniques. The projects primarily involve coding in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebooks** and include datasets for hands-on experiments.

## Projects Overview

### Algorithms Implemented from Scratch:
The repository showcases several machine learning algorithms that have been implemented from scratch. These include:

- **Neural Networks (Deep Learning)**: A fundamental project for building neural networks, which are a core component of deep learning.
- **Support Vector Classifiers (SVC)**: Implemented to classify data based on support vector machine principles.
- **Decision Trees**: Built to model decisions and their possible consequences, such as a tree structure of decisions.
- **Regression Trees**: A variant of decision trees that handles regression tasks.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: An optimization method for finding the minimum of a function in machine learning models.
- **MiniBatch Gradient Descent**: A variant of gradient descent that uses mini-batches to update parameters and speed up the process.

### Data:
The repository also includes various datasets, more or less, for training and testing the implemented algorithms. These datasets cover a variety of domains and problem types, providing ample opportunities to apply the machine learning techniques discussed.

### Technologies and Libraries Used:
- **Python** for coding.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for an interactive environment to experiment with machine learning algorithms.
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks and run the code cells sequentially.
4. Explore and experiment with different algorithms and datasets.
