We are building a regression tree

boosting is like playing golf. First you hit quite hard. Then you try multiple times to come as near to the hole as possible. 

log odds = number of positives / number of negatives

don't make it that deep to avoid overfitting

cheack that the code is for  regressionj nd not clasification.  75% of students made this mistake. xg boost i think.
